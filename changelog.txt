See [url=https://discord.com/channels/860671977449979914/864921239957012481]#magic-storage-changelog[/url] for more information.

- Made the Recursion Crafting feature significantly more stable
- The "server audit log" is now an opt-in feature in the Server Config
- The "right click ingredient to view recipe" feature is no longer disabled while recursion crafting is active
- Improved the netcode for Quick Stacking to no longer necessitate an inventory reorganization when an item wasn't fully quick-stacked
- The [i]Loading...[/i] prompt now waits for 45 game ticks before displaying itself
- Placing storage components will now properly update the frames of adjacent Connectors
- Added support for sharing items from the Storage UI and recipes from the Crafting UI (Alt+Click when chat bar is open)
- Added a safeguard to the rendering logic for the Required Objects text to prevent an edge case that could print an error to the chat
- Added safeguards to prevent lag and crashes when using the "right click stack splitting" logic when withdrawing items from storage or the Crafting UI's result slot
- Added a brief delay when opening the Storage and Crafting UIs before their item slots can be interacted with
- Added a new control to the Controls tab of the Storage UI — [b]Item Deletion Mode[/b] — to allow easy deletion of item stacks from storage
- Fixed a bug where trying to craft a recipe whose ingredients were all fully researched would cause a crash
- Fixed a bug in recipe refreshing logic where it would sometimes ignore active filters
- Fixed an oversight where recipes wouldn't show their Required Objects unless the recipe's ingredient requirements were fulfilled
- Fixed an oversight where only a few "recipe conditions" would appear in the Required Objects list
- Fixed a bug where the hover text for the Reset button in the Storage/Crafting UIs would linger until hovering over something else in the UI
- Fixed an oversight where favoriting items/recipes wouldn't refresh the UI
- Fixed a bug which caused the crafting "Amount: X" target to always be reset to 1 after performing any craft
- Fixed a bug which caused the Configuration Interface's modules to end up in an invalid state when entering a world
- Fixed a bug where withdrawing/depositing items wouldn't properly refresh the UI in multiplayer
- Fixed a bug where the server was never able to properly detect if a client has the Server Operator status
- Fixed a bug where materials for recipes were not being consumed
- Fixed a bug where trying to withdraw items from the Crafting UI's result slot — when a module had added items — would result in a crash, duplicate items or unrelated item stacks being deleted
- Fixed an ancient bug where items in storage could temporarily disappear for multiplayer clients
- Added improved Spanish localizations
- Updated the localization files

Changes Unique to 1.4.4:
- Quick Stacking to Nearby Storage now properly proritizes nearby Remote Accesses rather than its linked Storage Heart
- Quick stacking to storage now plays the "item grab" sound when the items enter the Storage Heart / Remote Access
- Fixed a major bug in the quick stack netcode which caused items to be transformed into garbage
- Fixed a bug in the quick stack logic where it tried to quick stack hotbar items
- Fixed a bug where the Void Vault's inventory was not checked when quick stacking
- Fixed a bug where Quick Stacking to Nearby Storage would spawn a duplicate item particle
- Fixed a bug where the utility method used to check research stats always said an item was not researched
- Fixed the localizations for the custom "recipe condition" used by the [i]Combined Stations (Final Tier)[/i] crafting station
- Fixed a bug where trying to read [i]UnloadedGlobalItem[/i] data in certain methods — e.g. [i]Delete Unloaded Mod Data[/i] — would throw errors
